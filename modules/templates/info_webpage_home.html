<h2>Vision</h2>

<p>Wikipedia is a well known and widely used source of information. Wikipedia is massive, and its information is largely crowdsourced. As a result it is impossible to manually evaluate the continuously growing number of articles. Even so, Wikipedia users should be able to check the quality/credibility of the articles that they are using. We propose an automated version of the evaluation process that will give users a quality score and a confidence score for each article they want to use. There will also be breakdowns of how our program determined these scores so that users are not left in the dark. For the first term of this project, our team will make sure that we can scrape Wikipedia articles, run simple algorithms on them and then store our results in a database that can be queried later. The second term will be used to explore more complicated methods for evaluating the articles. While other projects have been done with the goal of automating the evaluation of Wikipedia articles, we hope that our deep dive into sentiment analysis and article and author connectivity graph analysis for evaluation will set our project apart. While other projects focus more heavily on the UI that displays the evaluation of a Wikipedia article to the user, we will focus more on the methods used to generate those results.
